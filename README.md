# ðŸ““ Notion-Inspired-Portfolio

This is my personal portfolio website, designed and developed using HTML & CSS, inspired by Notionâ€™s sleek and organized aesthetic. I built this space to showcase my journey in software development, my projects, and the skills Iâ€™ve gained along the way. The minimalist black-and-white design is intentionalâ€” as I want my projects to take center stage and speak for themselves.

Before diving into development, I also experimented with Figma to create a mockup of this website, which helped act as a style guide throughout the design process.

# ðŸš§ Work in Progress! ðŸš§

Some image assets are still pending, as I plan to collaborate with my artist friend for custom illustrations. Additionally, the Projects section currently features draft layouts and temporary images sourced from the internet, as I havenâ€™t uploaded all my past work yet. 


### Upcoming Improvements !!
There are still a few areas Iâ€™m actively working on to enhance the site:

- Web Responsiveness â€“ Ensuring the site looks great across different screen sizes.

- Inserting Actual Projects â€“ Replacing placeholder images with my real work.

- Interactive Project Pages â€“ Selecting a project in the gallery will direct visitors to a dedicated page documenting its development process, similar to a Notion page.
